# game

This project is the home of a *game* created by a bunch of cool cats from Oregon State University who met at the Open Source Lab and the Linux Users Group.
It is currently just an *idea*.
We like the idea of making a game, so we want to make a game, and there's no time like the present!

## What is the game?

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

## How do I play the game?

üôÅ

## What did you use to make the game?

There's no decided framework, code, or engine at the moment.

Here's some ideas of frameworks to use:

- [phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) (JavaScript)
- [piston](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston) (Rust)
- [love](https://love2d.org/) (lua)

## Direction?

Some of us want to make a game with a good story, some of us want to make a sidescroller, others want to just make a fun game that we will want to play.
ü§û Here's hoping we make something we're all happy with.

Most importantly, we want to have **fun** and make something **good**.

## Contributing?

‚ò∫Ô∏èÔ∏è Yes!
We would love your help! Just ping one of the contributors and we'll be glad to add you to the project.

If that's too much work, fork the repo, make a contribution, and then make a pull request.

If that's not your cup of tea, feel free to make an issue!
Issues are contributions too.
