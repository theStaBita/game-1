    Game mechanics
      Experiment with atmosphere.
    Basic directives:
      First level: Simon tells you to go through the door.
      Mini-game as level.
    2DS feel
    Direction is visually linear.
    Don't need to figure out what the goal is.
    Given simple directive, have to reach it.
    Little to no exposition.
    Side or top down.
